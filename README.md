This repository holds Java documentation samples of projects/hands-on activities that I have worked.

The file AndreusFaria_RaquelNunes_COM228Lab5 contains a GUI Java application that stores information about players and their games in a SQL Server database. The JDBC was used to provide the operations of Insert, Update and Display elements.
